# HigherOrderClustering
"Higher-order clustering with non-uniform hypergraphs", also known as "my Master's thesis" or "my first and last taste as a quasi-semi-almost-researcher". Brrr. 

So here I am, 5+ years after the end of my Master's degree, cleaning my old laptop - and what comes up out of nowhere? My master's thesis. I was very proud of this at the time - still am, in a matter of speaking.
I'm uploading it here, maybe it can be of help. I doubt it, but a woman can dream.
